# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
The dataset was created to host an Image classification Challenge.
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
It was originally created by Intel to host a challenge.

 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?
This is image data of Natural Scenes around the world.
- How many instances of each type are there? 
This Data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories.
- Is there any missing data?
No
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
No

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired?
The photos are by Jan Böttinger
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy?
N/A
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
Unknown

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.
The data is divided into training, testing and prediction, where the training and testing data is labeled (buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, street)
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)?
Unknown
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for?
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
No
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
Not particularly

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
Unknown
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?
Unknown

## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
Unknown
